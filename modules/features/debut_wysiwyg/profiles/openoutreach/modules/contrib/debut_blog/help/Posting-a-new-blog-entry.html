<li>The blog text can be typed directly into the body section or pasted as plain text from a text editor or word processing program (formatting will be lost.)</li>
<li>The button below the body section which should be set for "Filtered HTLM" has an adjacent "Formating help" link that lists which HTML tags will be allowed for you to format your text.  Or if you have the WYSIWYG feature enabled you will have a text editor for easily formatting your selection.</li>
<li>For most Blog posts, you will not need to adjust other settings, and can now preview and save (or just save.)</li>
<li>If you would like to change any settings, you can do so via menu settings, authoring information, etc., prior to saving.</li>
